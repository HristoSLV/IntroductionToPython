<p>One astonishing fact about Python is that it has a huge and diverse community of contributors. Essentially, that means that there are plenty of solutions to a vast range of problems in open access. This fact comes in handy, especially when you are working on your own projects. It's highly likely that you'll be able to find a proper task-specific package and use it effectively to meet your needs. Now we are going to learn about standard tools for package management in Python.</p><h5 id="what-is-pip">What is pip?</h5><p>By this time you've probably familiarized yourself with the Python <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6230" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a standard library is a collection of built-in modules that come pre-installed with the Python programming language. | These modules provide access to various useful functions and data structures, such as mathematical functions, string operations, and random number generation. The standard library is available on every system that has Python installed, making it a convenient and powerful resource for developers. Additionally, many widely-used algorithms can be found in the Python standard library or in external packages, providing ready-to-use functions for various problems.">standard library</a>. It contains a lot of useful <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6230" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a built-in module is a set of functions, classes, or variables that are made available to the Python interpreter by the Python core team. | These modules are pre-installed and can be used without any additional installation steps. They provide various functionalities such as working with Python data structures, file and directory operations, serialization, and deserialization, etc. For example, the `pickle` module is a built-in module that can work with various Python data structures. It has two functions `pickle.dump()` and `pickle.load()` for serialization and deserialization respectively. Another example is the `os` module, which provides functions for interacting with the operating system, such as getting the current working directory, changing the current working directory, etc. To use a built-in module, you can import it using the standard import statement, such as `import pickle` or `import os`.">built-in modules</a> and should be preinstalled with your Python distribution. In fact, one more thing that is preinstalled (starting with <strong>Python 3.4</strong>) is the standard package manager called <strong>pip</strong> (the acronym is commonly expanded as "Pip Installs Packages").</p><p><strong>Pip </strong>is designed both to extend the functionality of the standard library by installing the additional packages on your computer and to help you share your own projects and thereby contribute to the development of Python.</p><p>Now let's make sure that you have <strong>pip </strong>installed. All you need to do is to open a command prompt/terminal and run this line on Windows:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">py -m pip --version</code></pre><p>On Unix the command is a little different:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">python3 -m pip --version</code></pre><p>The output should report your current pip version. For example, now, in August 2025, the latest version is:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">pip 25.2 from c:\users\user\python\python313\lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.13)</code></pre><p>In case it's not installed (or you want to upgrade it), please follow these <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">installation instructions</a> specifically for your operating system.</p><p></p><div class="alert alert-warning"><p>If your terminal cannot find the <code class="java">pip</code> command, try to use <code class="java">pip3</code> instead.</p></div><p></p><h5 id="pip-capabilities">Pip capabilities</h5><p>Since <strong>pip</strong> is the recommended installer for Python, the most obvious and crucial command to begin with is <code class="java">install</code>. Have a look at the following line:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">pip install some_package</code></pre><p>The installation is really that simple. However, if you are interested in a certain version of the package, you need to specify it after the package name like this:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">pip install some_package==1.1.2</code></pre><p>Or, at least, define a minimal suitable version:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">pip install "some_package&gt;=1.1.2"</code></pre><p>Note that the last expression should be enclosed within double quotes for the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/6230" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a comparison operator is a symbol used to compare two values. | Common comparison operators include `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `==`, `&lt; =`, and `&gt; =`. They are used to compare integers, as well as any expression that returns an integer. For instance, given the defined variables `a` and `b`, the expression `a == b` checks if `a` is equal to `b`. Since comparison operations return a boolean value, they can be joined using logical operators. However, it is important to be aware of their priority, i.e., the order in which they are evaluated.">comparison operator</a> to be interpreted without any problem.</p><p>Another useful thing is the <code class="java">show</code> command. It shows information about installed packages, for instance, their version, author, license, location or requirements. Here is a general example:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">pip show some_package</code></pre><p>Also, the <code class="java">list</code> command might be of use. It lists all the packages you've installed on your computer in alphabetical order:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">pip list</code></pre><p>If you print the <code class="java">list</code> command with the option <code class="java">--outdated</code>, or just <code class="java">-o</code>, you'll get the list of outdated packages coupled with both the current and latest versions available.</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">pip list --outdated</code></pre><p>or with a bit shorter variant:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">pip list -o</code></pre><p>After executing one of the mentioned lines, you will see a similar output:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">first_package (Current: 2.1.1 Latest: 3.0.1)
second_package (Current: 4.2.1 Latest: 4.2.2)</code></pre><p>Having discovered outdated packages, you might want to update them to the newest available version:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">pip install --upgrade some_package</code></pre><p>To remove a package from your computer run the <code class="java">uninstall</code> command:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">pip uninstall some_package</code></pre><p>When developing your project, it may be advantageous to keep a list of packages to be installed, i.e. dependencies, in a special file (see <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Requirements File Format</a>). It is convenient because you can install the packages directly from it:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre><p>Of course, you are not supposed to write this file yourself listing all the necessary packages. It will be enough to run the code below in order to obtain it:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt</code></pre><p>Let's examine the line above in detail. <code class="java">freeze</code> is a command used to get all installed packages in the format of requirements. So all the packages you had installed before the execution of the command and presumably had used in some projects would be listed in the file named "requirements.txt". Furthermore, their exact versions would be specified (see <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#:~:text=Requirement%20Specifiers,-pip%20supports%20installing&amp;text=Generally%20speaking%2C%20a%20requirement%20specifier,supports%20the%20url_req%20%2Dform%20specification." rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Requirement Specifiers</a>).</p><p>Consider an example output of the <code class="java">freeze</code> command:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">beautifulsoup4==4.7.1
nltk==3.4.1
numpy==1.16.3
scikit-learn==0.21.1
scipy==1.3.0</code></pre><p>What's important is that <code class="java">freeze</code> actually lists <strong>all</strong> the installed libraries, which is rarely necessary and might be considered a bad practice. For this reason, we recommend that you take a more conscious approach and revise the obtained <em>requirements </em>file by yourself.</p><h5 id="summary">Summary</h5><p>Overall, we've learned the basics for package installation through <strong>pip</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>how to install packages (either a specific version or non-specific one),</p></li><li><p>how to create a <em>requirements </em>file and use it for installation,</p></li><li><p>how to obtain information about installed packages,</p></li><li><p>and, finally, how to uninstall packages.</p></li></ul><p>For further details, try consulting the <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/#" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">documentation</a> or running the command <code class="java">help</code>.</p><p>Now let's get to practice so that you can use all this information in the future!</p><p>Read more on this topic in <a href="https://hyperskill.org/blog/post/jupyter-notebook-a-complete-how-to-tutorial" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Jupyter Notebook — a complete how-to tutorial</a> on Hyperskill Blog.</p>
